InCollege Project: Week 7 Deliverable - Browse & Applying to
Job/Internships (with Report Enhancement)
Objective: This week, your team will complete the basic job board by enabling users to browse
all available job and internship listings, simulate the application process, and generate a
summary report of their own applications. All program input will continue to be read from a file,
all output will be displayed on the screen, and that same output will also be written to a file.
Focus Areas:
1. Job/Internship Browse:
o The "Browse Jobs/Internships" option, which was previously an "under
construction" message, will now become fully functional.
o When a user selects this option, the system should display a list of all available
job and internship postings that have been created.
o Each listing should show at least the Job Title, Employer, and Location to provide
a quick overview.
2. Viewing Full Job Details:
o Users should be able to select a specific job listing from the browsed list to view
its full details (Job Title, Description, Employer, Location, and Salary if provided).
3. Simulated Application Process:
o When viewing the full details of a job, the system should present an option to
"Apply for this Job."
o When a user chooses to apply, the system should simply register their interest.
For this alpha version, a complex application process (like uploading resumes or
cover letters) is not required.
o The system should record that the logged-in user has "applied" to this specific
job. This data should persist.
o The user should receive a confirmation message that their application has been
submitted (e.g., "Your application for [Job Title] at [Employer] has been
submitted.").
4. Job Application Summary Report Generation:
o After successfully applying for a job, or from a new option in the "Job
Search/Internship Menu" (e.g., "View My Applications"), the user can request a
report.
o This report will list all job/internship postings that the currently logged-in user
has applied for.
o For each application, the report should display:
 The Job Title
 The Employer
 The Location
 (Optional but good) A unique identifier for the application or the job.
o The report should include a simple header (e.g., "Your Job Applications") and
potentially a count of total applications.
o This report output must adhere to the standard I/O
requirements: displayed on screen and written to the output file.
5. I/O Requirements:
o Input: All user input (e.g., menu selections, job selections, application
confirmations, report request) will be read from a predefined input file.
o Output Display: All program output (e.g., prompts, confirmation messages,
displayed job lists, full job details, and the new report) must be displayed on the
screen (standard output).
o Output Preservation: The exact same output displayed on the screen must also
be written to a separate output file for testing and record-keeping purposes.
COBOL Implementation Details (For Programmers):
• Job Listing Retrieval & Display: Develop COBOL modules to read all job postings from
your persistent storage (created in Week 6) and display them in a list format.
• Detailed Job Display: Implement COBOL routines to retrieve and display the full details
of a selected job posting.
• Application Data Structure: Define a new COBOL data structure (e.g., a new sequential
file or an addition to an existing one) to store job applications. This structure will need
fields to link the applying user (their username) with the specific job posting (e.g., using
a job ID or a combination of job details).
• File I/O for Applications: Implement COBOL file operations to write new application
records to your persistent storage.
• Report Generation Module: Develop a dedicated COBOL module or section for
generating the "Job Application Summary Report." This will involve:
o Reading the persistent application data.
o Filtering records to only include applications by the logged-in user.
o Formatting the output for the report header, detail lines, and summary (e.g.,
total count).
o Using DISPLAY for screen output and WRITE for the output file simultaneously for
the report.
• Input File Handling: Continue to implement COBOL READ statements to read user input
from the designated input file for all menu selections, job selections, application
confirmations, and report requests.
• Output File Handling: Ensure all program output, including prompts, displayed job
information, and the generated report, is written to your dedicated output file
identically to what is displayed on the screen.
• Menu Integration: Ensure the "Browse Jobs/Internships" option navigates correctly, the
"Apply for this Job" option appears, and add the new "View My Applications" option
within the "Job search/internship" sub-menu.
Testing Responsibilities (For Testers):
• Test Case Development: Create comprehensive test cases in Jira for all Week 7
functionalities, including:
o Browse Jobs: Scenarios for viewing an empty job list, a list with one job, and a
list with multiple jobs.
o Viewing Job Details: Test selecting existing jobs and attempting to select nonexistent job numbers.
o Applying to Jobs: Scenarios for successfully applying to a job.
o Report Generation: Test generating the report when the user has no
applications, one application, and multiple applications. Verify report formatting
(header, detail lines, total count).
o Persistence: Ensure job applications and the data used for the report persist
across program restarts.
• Test Execution: Execute all developed test cases using the specified input file.
• Bug Reporting: For every issue or discrepancy found, create a detailed bug ticket in Jira.
Include steps to reproduce, actual results, and expected results.
• Output Verification: Meticulously compare the program's console output against the
generated output file to ensure they are absolutely identical for all job Browse,
application, and report generation scenarios.
• Collaboration: Work closely with the programmers to help them understand and
reproduce bugs.
Jira Requirements (For Scrum Master, Programmers, & Testers):
Your team's Jira board for Week 7 should continue building on Epic #4: Job Board Functionality
and include:
• User Stories for Browse Jobs:
o "As a logged-in user, I want to browse all available job and internship listings."
o "As a user Browse jobs, I want to see a summary of each listing (title, employer,
location)."
o "As a user, I want to view the full details of a specific job posting once I select it."
• User Stories for Applying to Jobs:
o "As a logged-in user, I want to apply for a job or internship posting."
o "As a user applying for a job, I want my application to be recorded persistently."
o "As a user, I want to receive a confirmation message after applying to a job."
• NEW User Stories for Application Report:
o "As a logged-in user, I want to view a report summarizing all the jobs/internships
I have applied for."
o "As a user viewing the application report, I want to see the job title, employer,
and location for each applied position."
o "As a user viewing the application report, I want a clear header and a count of
my total applications."
• New User Story (for Testing): "As a tester, I want the program
to read all user inputs for job Browse, application, and report generation from a file so I
can automate testing."
• New User Story (for Testing): "As a tester, I want the program to write all screen output
related to job Browse, application, and report generation to a file so I can easily verify
results."
• Tasks: Break down each User Story into granular tasks that individual team members
can work on. (e.g., Programmers: "Develop COBOL routine to read and display all job
summaries," "Implement COBOL module to display full job details," "Define COBOL file
structure for job applications," "Create COBOL routine to record an application,"
"Develop COBOL module for application report generation," "Integrate 'View My
Applications' option into menu," "Update I/O for job Browse, application, and report
generation features to use file input/output consistently." Testers: "Develop test cases
for job Browse/details," "Develop test cases for applying to jobs," "Develop test cases
for application report generation," "Execute all Week 7 tests," "Log bugs," "Verify I/O
consistency").
• Bug Tickets: Log any issues found during development and testing.
GitHub Requirements:
• New Modules/Files: Commit any new COBOL modules or updated existing files for
Browse jobs, handling applications, and generating the application report.
• Branching: Continue to follow your team's established branching strategy for new
features.
• Regular Commits: Ensure consistent, descriptive commits throughout the week. Testers
should commit their test files.
• README.md Update: Update your README.md to reflect the new functionality, explicitly
detailing how to prepare input for these features and where to find the corresponding
output, including the new report.
Deliverables for End of Week 7:
1. Roles.txt: List of team members and the roles that they played this week.
2. InCollege.cob: Working COBOL Program: A console-based COBOL application that
allows logged-in users to:
o Navigate to the "Job search/internship" menu.
o Select an option to "Browse Jobs/Internships" and see all available listings.
o Select a listing to view its full details.
o "Apply" for a job, with the application being recorded persistently and a
confirmation message displayed.
o Generate and display a "Job Application Summary Report" of their own
applications.
o This must seamlessly integrate with all previous weeks'
functionality. All inputs must be read from a file, all outputs displayed on the
screen, and the exact same outputs written to a separate file.
3. InCollege-Input.txt: Sample Input File: A sample text file demonstrating the format of
input your program expects for Week 7's functionality (e.g., menu choices, job selection
ID, application confirmation, report request).
4. InCollege-Output.txt: A sample text file showing the expected output for a typical run of
your program, demonstrating Browse, applying to jobs, and generating the application
report.

Your testers will be critical this week in verifying that all job listings are displayed correctly, that
the full details appear when a job is selected, that the application process successfully records
the user's interest, and that the new application report accurately reflects the user's
applications. They will also meticulously compare the console output with the generated
output file to ensure perfect consistency across all features, including the report. The scrum
master will continue to facilitate daily stand-ups and remove any impediments for the team.
